# And The Winner is…

The survey results are finally in.

I had four illustrators to choose from. It was relatively easy to reduce that number to two. But then it got really hard. Both illustrators are true artist and been very attentive to details. Friends and family gave mixed feedback, so I needed to collect more serious data.

## Which one would you have chosen?

Interesting is that the difference between all respondents compared to the group that at least has bought 1 children’s picture book in the last 5 years is not significant different at all. Both illustrations are perceived similar professional made, which is great. But in all other areas the data shows a clear winner!

And the winner is….
